//then have a variable that counts the number of times you lift the robot

//how to write the functions:


//make while function that says has an if pressed function
//make a function that 1. lifts the robot by setting the motor to the highest speed for 2 seconds * the count number
//2. increment by 1 for count variable
//3. multiply count variable by 2 seconds and set motors to go in reverse
